<h2>Git and Github for complete beginner</h2>
    <p class="style">I am learning github tactics such  as push/pull request,merge branch with master and so on so forth.Although it's tough for a beginner to get accustomed to Git but in the long run every CS background need to learn git as it is a version control system and as a software developer we need to take the version control system in concern to maintain the consistency of any software's update logs and such.</p>

    <h2>What is GIT ?</h2>
    <p class="style">Git is a free, open-source version control software. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. This tool is a version control system that was initially developed to work with several developers on the Linux kernel.This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — and it is mostly used to store code because of the other features it provides.Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So they need a version control system like Git to make sure that there are no code conflicts between them.
        
        Also, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of their code.
        
        The branch system in Git allows developers to work individually on a task (For example: One branch -> One task OR One branch -> One developer). Basically think of Git as a small software application that controls your code base, if you’re a developer.</p>
